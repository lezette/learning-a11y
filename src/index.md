	Hello I'm Elizabeth,
</p>
<p class="my-8">
	I'm a frontend developer, and Web Accessibility (A11y) is truly important to me. This site is my personal journal where I document my journey to becoming a <span class="font-bold">Web Accessibility Specialist</span> (WAS). Along the way, I'll be sharing what I learn so you might find something useful too!
</p>

<p class="my-8">
Writing helps me understand things better, and teaching others reinforces my learning. Thatâ€™s my main motivation for this blog. I hope it serves as both a learning resource and a reflection of my growth.
