		👋🏾 Heya, I'm Elizabeth!
	</p>
	<p class="my-8">
		I'm a frontend developer, and Web Accessibility (A11y) is truly important to me. This blog is my personal journal
		where I document my journey, especially as I prepare for the <strong>IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)
			certification.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>The Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) certification is offered by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). It is designed for professionals who have hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating web accessibility.</p>
	<p class="my-8">
		Writing helps me understand things better, and teaching reinforces my learning. That’s my main motivation for this
		blog. I hope this blog serves as both a learning resource, a reflection of my growth, and that you find it
		helpful, relatable, and maybe even a little fun ✨
