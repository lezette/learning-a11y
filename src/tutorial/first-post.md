  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">Hey there,</p>
  <p>I don’t like public commitments—but here I am, doing this publicly.</p>
  <p>Web accessibility has always been an integral part of me being a frontend developer, I generally don't like the
    idea of <span class="font-semibold italic">limiting people</span> and knowing that something I build might be <span
      class="font-semibold italic">inaccessible</span> due to my ignorance just doesn’t sit right with me.</p>
  <p>But I've come to understand that <span class="font-semibold italic"> accessibility goes beyond just writing
      accessible code </span> and I keep realizing how much I don’t know so I've decided to do something about it.</p>
  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Goal</p>
  <p>I want to master web accessibility and gain the confidence to call myself a <abbr>WAS</abbr> (Web Accessibility
    Specialist)</p>
  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Plan</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spend at least 30 minutes daily learning something on accessibility</li>
    <li>Follow the IAAP WAS Body of Knowledge (BoK) (Oct 2024 update) for structured learning</li>
    <li>Understand the W3C accessibility resources</li>
    <li>Get comfortable with <abbr>AT</abbr> (Assistive Technologies)</li>
    <li>Understand the European Accessibility (EN 301 549)</li>
    <li>Run accessibility audits to better understand WCAG 2.2</li>
    <li>Update this blog with insights, tutorials, and takeaways</li>
    <li>Prepare for and take the IAAP WAS certification exam</li>
    <li>Become a WAS <span aria-hidden="true">😊</span></li>
  </ul>
