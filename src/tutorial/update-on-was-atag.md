  <p class="big-text">I'm Officially Done with ATAG! ðŸŽ‰</p>

  <p>You can check out my overview article, <a href="/tutorial/authoring-tool-accessibility-guidelines-overview/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
      Overview</a></p>

  <p>This past weekend was busy, but I still managed to finish studying ATAG. If you had asked me two months ago what
    ATAG was, I probably would have guessed it was some complicated acronym related
    to a secret government project. As it turns out, ATAG is simply a set of guidelines designed to make authoring tools
    accessible.</p>

  <p>One interesting observation is how frequently ATAG refers to WCAG. It almost feels like ATAG is WCAG's younger
    sibling who constantly mentions how great their older sibling is. This highlights just how comprehensive and widely
    used WCAG is.</p>

  <p>Next, I'll be studying Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.2. I'm genuinely looking forward to this.
    While I've used ARIA roles in HTML before, I've never thoroughly read the documentation. I'm sure I'll uncover some
    mistakes I've made in the past and learn about features I didn't know existed.</p>

  <p>That's it for today. Thanks for following my journey. See you next time!</p>
