  <h3>Clause 12: Documentation and Support Services</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>Clause 12 covers product documentation and support services that come with ICT, whether standalone, integrated, or
    provided separately. This clause applies to help materials, user manuals, onboarding guides, support center
    communication, and more.</p>

  <h4>12.1 Product Documentation</h4>
  <h5>12.1.1 Accessibility and Compatibility Features</h5>
  <p>The documentation must explain all accessibility and compatibility features of the product. This includes built-in
    accessibility features (like high contrast mode) and features that enable compatibility with assistive technology
    (like screen reader support).</p>
  <p>The goal is to help users understand how to activate and use these features effectively.</p>
  <p>Example: A software manual should describe how to activate keyboard shortcuts, turn on voice feedback, or connect
    with external AT like braille displays.</p>

  <h5>12.1.2 Accessible Documentation Format</h5>
  <p>Product documentation must be available in at least one accessible electronic format:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web-based format that follows Clause 9 (it conforms to WCAG 2.1 for web content), or</li>
    <li>Non-web document format that follows Clause 10 (like accessible PDFs, DOCX, ePub, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This requirement does not ban additional formats like: printed guides, non-accessible PDFs, audio-only recordings
    It just ensures that at least one version must be accessible.</p>
  <p class="note">Alternate formats (e.g. Braille, Easy Read) are strongly encouraged for specific disability groups.
  </p>
  <p>Example: A screen reader-friendly PDF and/or accessible HTML help page should be available alongside print copies.
  </p>

  <h4>12.2 Support Services</h4>
  <h5>12.2.1 General Context (informative)</h5>
  <p>Support services must be inclusive of people with disabilities. These support services include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>help desks</li>
    <li>call centers</li>
    <li>technical support</li>
    <li>relay services</li>
    <li>training sessions</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>12.2.2 Information on A11y & Compatibility Features</h5>
  <p>Support staff must be able to explain the accessibility and compatibility features described in the documentation.
    The information should be provided accurately and clearly, to help users activate or troubleshoot features.</p>
  <p>Example: If a blind user calls support, the agent should know how to guide them through enabling keyboard
    navigation or compatibility with NVDA.</p>

  <h5>12.2.3 Effective Communication</h5>
  <p>Support must accommodate different communication needs. This includes spoken, text, sign language, or assisted
    channels.</p>
  <p>Support should be available either directly (e.g. via relay services, email) or through referral points (e.g.
    directing users to appropriate accessible contact channels).</p>
  <p>Example: A deaf user should be able to contact support through email, chat, or video relay, not just phone calls.
  </p>

  <h5>12.2.4 Accessible Support Documentation</h5>
  <p>Any documentation produced by support services (e.g. email replies, troubleshooting guides) must be available in at
    least:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a web format (Clause 9), or</li>
    <li>a non-web format (Clause 10)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Again, other non-accessible or alternate formats can still be provided, but at least one format must meet
    accessibility requirements.</p>
