  <h3>Clause 10: Non-web documents</h3>
  <p>Clause 10 ensures that documents not rendered as web pages are still accessible. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PDFs, DOCXs, PPTs, ePubs, spreadsheets, videos, etc.</li>
    <li>Content not embedded directly in web pages (e.g., downloadable resources)</li>
    <li>Files that require a user agent (like a PDF reader, document viewer, or media player)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Clause 10 mirrors WCAG 2.1 SCs but interprets them through the WCAG2ICT lens, i.e., it adapts web-specific
    terminology to fit documents that need a user agent (like Acrobat, Word, PowerPoint) for access.</p>
  <p>Many WCAG SCs are kept exactly as they are (e.g., 1.1.1 Non-text Content), but others have customized explanations,
    particularly where WCAG speaks to "pages" or "sites".</p>

  <h5>Adaptations for Document-Specific Behaviors</h5>
  <p>Non-web documents have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No DOM (in the same sense)</li>
    <li>No live navigation tree or URL structure</li>
    <li>Interaction managed via document viewers/editors, not browsers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So EN 301 549 introduces tweaks to maintain meaning and functionality in this different environment.</p>

  <h5>Unique Characteristics of Clause 10</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Some SCs, it uses tables to define equivalent document-specific behavior.</li>
    <li>Best practice notes and exceptions: Adds informative guidance where WCAG didn't cover documents in detail.</li>
    <li>No WCAG 2.1 Conformance Requirement 5: You'll see this removed in SCs like Keyboard Trap, Audio Control, etc.
      because documents don't have the same layered structure as web pages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Example of Clause 10 Tweaks:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1.4.2 Audio Control</strong> becomes "If audio in a document plays automatically for more than 3
      seconds..."</li>
    <li><strong>2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</strong></li>
    <li><strong>2.4.2 Page Titled</strong> becomes "Documents have titles that describe topic or purpose.."</li>
    <li><strong>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</strong> is void as it doesn't apply to single documents</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Some Takeaways</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Clause 10 relies on WCAG2ICT interpretations. For example, a single PDF doesn't need "multiple ways to navigate"
      like a site, so SC 2.4.5 is skipped (marked void).</li>
    <li>Emphasis is placed on non-interference, any part of a document that interferes with usage (e.g. autoplaying
      audio, flashing elements) invalidates conformance.</li>
    <li>"Best practice" notes encourage things like accessibility metadata to be included.</li>
  </ul>
