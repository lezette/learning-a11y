<div class="text-xl/8 space-y-6">
  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">Hey there,</p>
  <p>I donâ€™t like public commitmentsâ€”but here I am, doing this publicly.</p>
  <p>Web accessibility has always been an integral part of me being a frontend developer, I generally don't like the idea of <span class="font-semibold italic">limiting people</span> and knowing that something I build might be <span class="font-semibold italic">inaccessible</span> due to my ignorance just doesnâ€™t sit right with me.</p>
  <p>But I've come to understand that <span class="font-semibold italic"> accessibility goes beyond just writing accessible code </span> and I keep realizing how much I donâ€™t knowâ€”so I've decided to do something about it.</p>
  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Goal</p>
  <p>I want to master web accessibility and gain the confidence to call myself a <abbr>WAS</abbr> (Web Accessibility Specialist)</p>
  <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Plan</p>
  <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 ml-10">
    <li>Spend at least 2 hours daily learning about accessibility</li>
    <li>Follow the IAAP WAS Body of Knowledge (BoK) (Oct 2024 update) for structured learning</li>
    <li>Understand the W3C accessibility resources</li>
    <li>Get comfortable with <abbr>AT</abbr> (Assistive Technologies)</li>
    <li>Understand the European Accessibility (EN 301 549)</li>
    <li>Run accessibility audits to better understand WCAG 2.2</li>
    <li>Update this blog with insights, tutorials, and takeaways</li>
    <li>Prepare for and take the IAAP WAS certification exam/li>
    <li>Become a WAS <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ˜Š</span></li>
  </ul>
   <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">Join Me on This Path</p>
  <p>You can follow along as I update this blog with insights, learnings, and challenges. Maybe youâ€™ll learn something newâ€”or maybe youâ€™ll just enjoy the journey with me! </p>
  <p>You could also check out my past articles on <a href="https://dev.to/ilizette" target="_blank">dev.to (opens in a new tab).</a> where Iâ€™ve written about specific web accessibility topics.</p>
  <p>This idea was inspired by Amy Carneyâ€™s <a href="https://100daysofa11y.com/" target="_blank">100 Days of A11y (opens in new tab)</a></p>
