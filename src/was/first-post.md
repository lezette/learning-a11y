<div class="blog">
  <p>Welcome to the WAS section of my blog! This space is dedicated to my journey studying for the IAAP Web
    Accessibility Specialist (WAS) exam, based on the official <a
      href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/sfsites/c/resource/WASBoK_PDF" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Body of Knowledge v2.3 (2024)</a>.</p>
  <p>Unlike my tutorials, this isn't a deep dive, Instead, I'm journaling what I've learned, what made sense,
    what confused me at first, and how I made progress. If you're also preparing for the WAS exam (or just want a peek
    into accessibility in practice), this might help you too.</p>

  <h3>WAS Content Overview</h3>
  <p>The exam is divided into three domains, each with a specific percentage weight. I'll be writing posts aligned with
    this structure.</p>

  </ul>
