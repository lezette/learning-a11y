  <h3>I'm done studying all of WCAG's layers</h3>

  <p>I wrote an overview of the <a href="/tutorial/an-overview-of-the-robust-principle/">Robost Principle</a>. The
    Robust
    principle ensures that web platforms are built in a way that's standard so that different technologies (like
    browsers and Assistive technologies), now and in the future, can understand it clearly. The principle has one
    guideline and 2 active success criteria (SC). "two active success criteria" because 4.1.1 Parsing was removed in
    WCAG 2.2 because the requirement is now obsolete. The two active SC are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</li>
    <li>4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p><strong>4 Principles, 13 guidelines and 86 Success Criteria</strong> including techniques and common failures.
    It's been a ride, but I'm proud to say I understand all the success criteria, I didn't memorize all of them (I'm not
    Mike Ross) but I know what each of them is about, how to meet them and who they help. Studying WCAG also help me
    understand just how important a11y is, it's benefitial for everyone but really important to some people.</p>

  <p>I created a <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gs3P-1F4ATPrsx87_16RoQVLZVaIRI5Np2rEhnIL9fM/edit?usp=sharing"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheet</a> that I'll keep updating for a summary of everything
    I'll be learning, it currently
    contains WCAG layers.</p>

  <p>While studying WCAG I've also been using the VoiceOver (VO) screen reader more than often and navigating websites
    with keyboard, I've been using VO for a while now, however, I find it challenging to use for a long period of time,
    I mostly only use it for accessibility testing, and using VO on mobile is quite challenging for me but part of my
    goal for this journey is to be quite comfortable with VO on mobile and familiarize myself with JAWS, NVDA, and,
    Talkback (I don't have access to both a PC and an Android for now)
  </p>

  <p>Since I'm following IAAP's body of knowledge <abbr title="body of knowledge">BoK</abbr> the next step is to
    study Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. Like WCAG, ATAG is organised into Principles, Guidelines
    and Success Criteria and refers to WCAG. I can't wait to jump into it tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading, have a nice day!</p>
