<div class="blog">
  <p>Welcome to the WAS section of my blog! This space is dedicated to my journey studying for the IAAP Web
    Accessibility Specialist (WAS) exam, based on the official <a
      href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/sfsites/c/resource/WASBoK_PDF" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Body of Knowledge v2.3 (2024)</a>.</p>
  <p>Unlike my tutorials, this isn't a step-by-step how-to. Instead, I'm journaling what I've learned, what made sense,
    what confused me at first, and how I made progress. If you're also preparing for the WAS exam (or just want a peek
    into accessibility in practice), this might help you too.</p>

  <h3>WAS Content Overview</h3>
  <p>The exam is divided into three domains, each with a specific percentage weight. I'll be writing posts aligned with
    this structure.</p>
  <h4>Domain One: Creating Accessible Web Solutions (40%)</h4>
  <p>This part covers theory and techniques for building accessible content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>WCAG, ATAG, WAI-ARIA, EN 301 549</li>
    <li>Semantic HTML and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Focus management and state handling</li>
    <li>Accessibility-supported technologies</li>
    <li>Single Page Applications (SPA) considerations</li>
    <li>Understanding strategies used by people with disabilities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This part focuses on accessibility testing and evaluation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Testing with assistive technologies (AT)</li>
    <li>Identifying WCAG failures and assigning SC</li>
    <li>Using testing tools (automated + manual)</li>
    <li>WCAG-EM methodology</li>
    <li>Real-world impact testing (cognitive, low vision, touch, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Domain Three: Remediating Accessibility Issues (20%)</h4>
  <p>This part centers on fixing accessibility issues and recommending solutions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritizing based on severity</li>
    <li>Communicating findings</li>
    <li>Integrating accessibility into procurement and QA processes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you're also studying for the WAS exam too, welcome!, and let's do this together. And if If you're just here to
    vibe and learn accessibility, that's cool too üòÅ</p>
