  <p>This should have been a Friday/Saturday update, but life got in the way as it does.</p>

  <p>On Friday and Saturday, I decided to revisit VoiceOver (VO) on iOS. I'm already fairly comfortable using VO on
    MacBooks, but using it on iPhones used to feel frustrating and overwhelming. I figured it was time to give it
    another go and it was less confusing this time (progress, yay!).</p>

  <p>I ended up getting so into it that I used VO longer than I originally planned. I tried navigating through a few
    apps, and I realized how often <strong>mobile accessibility is overlooked</strong>. Some apps were basically
    unusable with VO. For example, I couldn't even log in to a bank application, despite there being a visible login
    button. Something seemed to be visually and programmatically blocking the login
    page It was weird, and definitely frustrating.</p>
  <p>That said, some apps were usaable with VO. The Settings app, Messaging, and WhatsApp were quite accessible, with
    logical navigation and well-labeled elements.</p>

  <h3>Getting Started with VoiceOver on iOS</h3>
  <p>If you're new to VoiceOver on iOS, the best way to get started is to follow the built-in VoiceOver tutorial in
    <strong>Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver</strong>. It walks you through gestures and navigation in a
    beginner-friendly way.
  </p>

  <p>I also watched a helpful video on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROIe49kXOc8&t=19s"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver</a>. It helped me
    understand how to navigate to the Home screen, open the Control Center, and generally move around the UI more
    confidently.</p>

  <h3>Some VoiceOver Features I Found Interesting</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gestures:</strong> VoiceOver uses a unique set of gestures. For example, you can swipe left or right to
      move between
      items, double-tap to activate, and use a three-finger swipe to scroll. It takes some getting used to, but
      once you do, it's pretty intuitive.</li>
    <li><strong>Screen Curtain:</strong> You can triple-tap with three fingers to enable it. This turns off the display
      while still allowing you to use the phone with VoiceOver—useful for privacy or reducing screen distractions.</li>
    <li><strong>Rotor:</strong> By rotating two fingers on the screen (like turning a dial), you can change how
      VoiceOver navigates—by headings, links, form controls, etc. It's super helpful once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li><strong>App-specific navigation:</strong> Some apps behave better than others, but VO generally lets you swipe
      through elements, activate buttons with a double-tap, and navigate back using the scrub gesture (a two-finger "Z"
      motion).</li>
    <li><strong>Practice mode:</strong> You can go to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Practice Gestures to safely
      try out gestures without doing anything unintended.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Some VO users probably rely on <strong>headphones</strong> a lot, especially in public, since everything gets read
    aloud. That made me think more about the privacy and comfort aspects of using screen readers in everyday life.
  </p>

  <p>Even though I found VoiceOver confusing at first, the iOS tutorial helped a lot, and with a little patience, I
    started getting the hang of it. I still need more practice, but it's no longer as intimidating.</p>

  <p>Testing with VO across different apps gave me a deeper appreciation of how important <strong>mobile
      accessibility</strong> is. It's one thing to test with a screen reader on desktop, but mobile has a whole
    different set of challenges; touch targets, gestures, visual hierarchy, and more.</p>

  <p>Advocating for accessibility is a huge part of my work, and I want to make sure I'm doing it right. I believe it's
    important to understand how people with disabilities interact with technology. I want to be able to empathize with
    their experiences and advocate for better accessibility in the products I work on and use.</p>

  <p>I'll definitely keep practicing with VO on iOS. It's too important to skip.</p>
