  <h3>Clause 4 - Functional Performance (EN 301 549)</h3>
  <p>So, the <strong>normative part</strong> of EN 301 549 starts from <strong>Clause 4</strong>, and honestly? I like
    that it doesn't just jump straight into standards and technical specs. </p>

  <p>Clause 4 starts with <strong>why</strong> the rest of the standard exists. It's like saying: <q>Let's talk about
      what people actually need before we get into how you're going to meet those needs.</q></p>


  <h4>Clause 4.2 - Functional Performance Statements</h4>
  <p>Clause 4.2 lists out 11 functional needs, basically saying <q>your product should let people:</q></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use it <strong>without vision</strong> (e.g. screen readers, audio feedback)</li>
    <li>Use it with <strong>limited vision</strong> (e.g. zoom, high contrast)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>without perceiving color</strong> (e.g. labels, icons)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>without hearing</strong> (e.g. captions, visual alerts)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>with limited hearing</strong> (e.g. volume control, noise reduction)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>without speech</strong> (e.g. text or touch alternatives)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>with limited dexterity or strength</strong> (e.g. keyboard navigation, single-handed interaction)
    </li>
    <li>Use it <strong>with limited reach</strong> (e.g. reachable touchpoints, wheelchair-friendly layouts)</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid seizure triggers</strong> (e.g. no rapid flashing)</li>
    <li>Use it <strong>with cognitive or learning challenges</strong> (e.g. clear instructions, step-by-step flows,
      word prediction)</li>
    <li>Use accessibility features privately and securely (e.g. headphone jacks, masked inputs)</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>What Stood Out the Most</h4>
  <p><strong>Privacy.</strong></p>
  <p>Clause 4.2.11 says that people who rely on accessibility features shouldn't have to
    sacrifice their privacy to use a product. I totally agree with that because so many accessibility tools are public,
    loud, or revealing and that <strong>can</strong> expose sensitive information.</p>

  <p>It's one of the first standards I've read that acknowledges privacy. It's not something <strong>WCAG</strong> talks
    about, and it feels like a big step toward <strong>dignity-centered</strong> accessibility.
  </p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>I like that Clause 4 reframe accessibility as not just technical compliance, but human-centered design. To me it
    feels like a pep talk before all the technical clauses, like saying <q>This is why we're doing this</q>.</p>
