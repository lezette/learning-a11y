  <h3>A Quick Detour into the European Accessibility Act (EAA)</h3>

  <p>While reading resourses EN 301 549, I kept seeing the <strong>European Accessibility Act (EAA)</strong> pop up,
    especially in
    updates to the standard. So I paused to read about it a bit, and here's what I picked up:
  </p>

  <h4>What the EAA Is</h4>
  <p>The <strong>European Accessibility Act</strong> is an EU directive that aims to make certain <strong>products and
      services</strong> more accessible across Europe, The EAA doesn't cover just websites. The EAA covers products,
    transport apps, ATMs,
    e-books etc. It was adopted in 2019 and is supposed to be enforced across EU member states by <strong>28 June
      2025</strong>. ðŸ‘€
    (Yes, this year.)
  </p>
  <h4>What the EAA Covers</h4>
  <p>The EAA covers to a broad set of ICT-related areas, including:</p>

  - Websites and mobile apps of private businesses
  - E-commerce platforms
  - E-books and e-readers
  - Banking services and terminals (like ATMs)
  - Ticket machines and check-in kiosks
  - Transport information services
  - Telecom services (like calls, messaging, 112 emergency access)

  <h4>How It Relates to EN 301 549</h4>

  <p>EN 301 549 is being updated to support the <strong>EAA</strong>, meaning new clauses and revisions are based on
    what the EAA demands.</p>
  <p>So if EN 301 549 is the standard (the how), the EAA is the law (the why) The Act creates the legal requirement, and
    the standard provides the technical compliance path.</p>

  <h4>Why This Matters for WAS Prep</h4>
  <p>Even though the <strong>WAS exam</strong> focuses more on web accessibility and EN 301 549 (not policy
    enforcement), understanding
    the EAA gives good context for why accessibility standards are expanding.</p>

  <h4>What I'm Still Curious About</h4>

  - Whether non-EU countries (like Nigeria where I'm based) will create something similar or adopt parts of it,

  - How businesses will handle compliance across <strong>both</strong> the EAA and national accessibility laws

  - What kind of practical guidance will be available for small orgs

  <p>Next up: <strong>EN 301 549</strong> itself, the tech standard that translates all this into concrete requirements
    (and tables ðŸ˜…).</p>
