  <p>While reading resourses EN 301 549, I kept seeing the <strong>European Accessibility Act (EAA)</strong> pop up,
    especially in updates to the standard. So I paused to read about it a bit, and here's what I picked up:
  </p>

  <h3>What is EAA Is</h3>
  <p>The <strong>European Accessibility Act</strong> is an EU directive that aims to make certain <strong>products and
      services</strong> more accessible across Europe, The EAA doesn't cover just websites. The EAA covers
    transport apps, ATMs, e-books etc. It was adopted in 2019 and is supposed to be enforced across EU member states by
    <strong>28 June 2025</strong>. ðŸ‘€ (Yes, this year.)
  </p>
  <h3>What the EAA Covers</h3>
  <p>The EAA covers to a broad set of ICT-related areas, including:</p>

- Websites and mobile apps of private businesses
- E-commerce platforms
- E-books and e-readers
- Banking services and terminals (like ATMs)
- Ticket machines and check-in kiosks
- Transport information services
- Telecom services (like calls, messaging, 112 emergency access)

  <h3>How It Relates to EN 301 549</h3>

  <p>The <strong>EAA</strong> is a legislation (Directive 2019/882) adopted by the EU to ensure accessibility of
    products and services for persons with disabilities across the EU.</p>
  <p><strong>EN 301 549</strong> is a <strong>harmonized European standard</strong> that outlines "Accessibility
    requirements for ICT products and services." It is developed by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute), CEN (ComitÃ© EuropÃ©en de Normalisation), and CENELEC. The standard's purpose is to provide a
    comprehensive set of accessibility criteria for a wide range of ICT, including hardware, software, web content, and
    documents.
  </p>

  <p>EN 301 549 is being updated to support the <strong>EAA</strong>, meaning new clauses and revisions are based on
    what the EAA demands.</p>

  <p>So EN 301 549 is the <strong>technical standard</strong> (<em>the how</em>), the EAA is the <strong>law</strong>
    (<em>the why</em>). The Act creates
    the legal
    requirement, and the standard provides the technical compliance path.</p>
  <p>So when the EAA says, <q>products and services must be accessible</q> it relies on EN 301 549 (or similar
    harmonized standards) to define what "accessible" means in practice.</p>

  <h3>Why This Matters for WAS Prep</h3>
  <p>Even though the <strong>WAS exam</strong> focuses more on web accessibility and EN 301 549 (not policy
    enforcement), understanding
    the EAA gives good context for why accessibility standards are expanding.</p>

  <h3>Scope and Application of EN 301 549</h3>
  <p>The scope of EN 301 549 is broad, it covers a diverse range of ICT. The standard details specific accessibility
    requirements for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hardware (Section 8):</strong> This includes general requirements, standard connections, colour
      considerations, speech output features (volume gain, magnetic coupling), stationary ICT physical accessibility
      (reach, clearance, visibility), and mechanically operable parts (numeric keys, operation force, tickets).</li>
    <li><strong>Software (Section 11):</strong> Accessibility for software is broken down into key principles mirroring
      the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):
      <ul>
        <li>Perceivable: Covering text alternatives, time-based media, adaptability, and distinguishability.</li>
        <li>Operable: Focusing on keyboard accessibility, sufficient time, handling seizures and physical reactions,
          navigability, and input modalities.</li>
        <li>Understandable: Addressing readability, predictability, and input assistance.</li>
        <li>Robust: Primarily focusing on compatibility.</li>
        <li>Interoperability with Assistive Technology: Including closed functionality, accessibility services, and
          documented accessibility usage.</li>
        <li>User Preferences: Allowing users to control accessibility features.</li>
        <li>Authoring Tools: Specific requirements for tools used to create accessible content.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Web Content (Section 9):</strong> The standard aligns heavily with WCAG 2.1, incorporating many of its
      success criteria. This is evident in the detailed tables mapping requirements to WCAG principles (Perceivable,
      Operable, Understandable, Robust).</li>
    <li><strong>Non-web Documents (Section 10):</strong> Similar to web content, non-web documents downloadable from a
      web page are subject to accessibility requirements, also aligning with WCAG 2.1 success criteria.
    </li>
    <li><strong>ICT Providing Relay or Emergency Service Access (Section 13):</strong> Specific requirements are
      outlined for text, sign, lip-reading, captioned telephony, and speech-to-speech relay
      services, as well as access to emergency services.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation and Support Services (Section 12):</strong> Accessible product documentation and support
      services are also included within the scope.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who Needs to Comply?</h3>
  <p>Compliance with EN 301 549 has been mandatory for EU public sector websites and mobile applications since 2019
    under the Web Accessibility Directive. With the European Accessibility Act (EAA) set to take effect in June 2025,
    the scope of compliance will expand to include most private-sector organizations operating within the EU. This means
    that even businesses outside Europe, if they offer digital products or services to EU consumers, will need to adhere
    to EN 301 549 standards.</p>

  <h3>Global Adoption</h3>
  <p>EN 301 549's influence extends beyond Europe. Countries like Australia and Canada have adopted versions of the
    standard. AS EN 301 549 and CAN/ASC - EN 301 549, respectively. Other nations, including Japan, India, and Kenya,
    are
    also developing accessibility standards inspired by EN 301 549,</p>

  <p>Next up: <strong>EN 301 549</strong> itself, the tech standard that translates all this into concrete requirements
    (and tables ðŸ˜…).</p>
