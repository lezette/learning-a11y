  <p class="large-text">I finally completed the article on overview of the Operable Principle.</p>

  <p>You can read the post
    <a href="/was/an-overview-of-the-operable-principle/">An Overview of the Operable Principle</a>.
  </p>

  <p>I've also finished reading the Understandable Principle and hope to write an overview on it this weekend.</p>

  <p>WCAG 2.2 introduced four new success criteria to the Understandable Principle (Guideline 3):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3.2.6 Consistent Help</li>
    <li>3.3.7 Redundant Entry</li>
    <li>3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</li>
    <li>3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These additions make a lot of sense and are extremely important. I had many <em>"OH, THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY
      IMPORTANT"</em> moments while reading them. For example, consistent help ensures that if you have a "help"
    component, it remains consistent across your entire site and is easy to find. Redundant entry is also essential
    because no one likes entering the same information twiceâ€”another example of "accessibility is helpful to everyone."
    Accessible authentication is particularly interesting because some authentication methods, like puzzles, can be
    unnecessarily complicated. I'm glad WCAG addresses this.</p>

  <p>I can't wait to share everything about the Understandable Principle in my upcoming post.</p>

  <h3>Here's something I Found Interesting</h3>

  <p>Not disabling <code>user-select</code>: I noticed that when I'm reading digitally, it's easier to follow the text
    if I highlight the section I'm reading. It never felt like a big deal until I encountered a blog where the selection
    style was hidden, making it impossible to follow along because text selection wasn't working. This experience
    prompted me to read more about the <code>user-select</code> property and its effects on accessibility. I learned the
    following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some screen readers and assistive tools rely on text selection to read or interact with content. Disabling text
      selection can hinder these tools.</li>
    <li>Preventing text selection can frustrate users who wish to copy or highlight text for note-taking, sharing, or
      translating purposes.</li>
    <li>Like me, many people find it easier to read by highlighting content as they go.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So, while <code>user-select</code> might not explicitly be part of WCAG guidelines, it's best to avoid restricting
    users from selecting text unless absolutely necessary. If you decide to style your <code>::selection</code>
    behavior, ensure it follows WCAG's color contrast ratio guidelines to maintain readability. Avoid drastic changes to
    the selection appearance that could disorient users; subtle enhancements are best.</p>

  <p>I've included some resources I found on this topic below.</p>
