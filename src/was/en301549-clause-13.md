  <h3>Clause 13: ICT providing relay or emergency service access</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>Clause 13 covers accessibility of ICT systems that support two-way communication, especially those meant to work
    with relay services or emergency services. The goal is equal communication access for people with disabilities using
    modes like text, sign language, captioned calls, and speech-to-speech assistance.</p>
  <h4>13.1 Relay Services Requirements</h4>
  <h5>13.1.1 General (informative)</h5>
  <p>Relay services allow users of different communication modes (speech, text, sign language, etc.) to communicate
    remotely, often with a human operator converting between the modes.</p>
  <p>It is best practice to align with the <strong>ETSI standard ES 202 975</strong>, which defines good
    practices for relay service operation.</p>

  <h5>13.1.2 Text Relay Services</h5>
  <p>If the ICT system is meant to support text relay, it must allow real-time communication between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a user typing text</li>
    <li>and a user speaking aloud</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It must convert text to speech and vice versa to enable effective dialogue.</p>
  <p>Example: A deaf person types “I need an appointment.” The relay operator reads it aloud to a clinic receptionist,
    who replies verbally, and the operator types the spoken response back.</p>

  <h5>13.1.3 Sign Relay Services</h5>
  <p>If the system supports sign relay (aka video relay), it must allow conversion between sign language and spoken
    language. A sign language interpreter facilitates the two-way interaction between the signing user and the speaking
    user.</p>
  <p>Example: A Deaf user signs via video to a relay interpreter, who voices their message to the recipient, and signs
    the spoken reply back.</p>

  <h5>13.1.4 Lip-Reading Relay Services</h5>
  <p>If lip-reading support is included, the relay service must allow communication between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>someone who uses lip-reading</li>
    <li>and a voice telephone user</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It must bridge communication barriers via an intermediary that enables both users to understand each other.</p>
  <p>Example: During a phone call, the lip-reading relay service connects the user to a human operator who repeats the
    spoken conversation with clear articulation and facial visibility. The user watches the operator on video and reads
    their lips to follow the conversation in real time.</p>

  <h5>13.1.5 Captioned Telephony Services</h5>
  <p>If the ICT includes captioned telephony, it must provide text captions of the incoming audio during a phone call.
    This helps deaf or hard-of-hearing users follow spoken conversations in real time.
  </p>
  <p>Example: During a phone call, spoken responses from the other person are transcribed live and shown as captions to
    the user.</p>

  <h5>13.1.6 Speech-to-Speech Relay Services</h5>
  <p>If the system provides speech-to-speech relay, it must allow speech-impaired or cognitively/language-impaired users
    to speak or be understood by assisting in articulation or clarity</p>
  <p>The relay operator helps interpret unclear speech and may rephrase for better understanding.</p>

  <h4>13.2 Access to Relay Services</h4>
  <p>If an ICT system supports two-way communication and is designed to work with relay services it must not block
    outgoing or incoming relay service calls involving:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voice</li>
    <li>Real-Time Text (RTT)</li>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>Or any combination of those, provided both the ICT and relay service support them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ensures that persons with disabilities can access relay services as easily as voice users access regular phone
    services.</p>

  <h4>13.3 Access to Emergency Services</h4>
  <p>If the system is designed to interact with emergency services (e.g., 999, 112), it must not block access for people
    using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voice</li>
    <li>RTT</li>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>Or combinations of those methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This enusres that people with disabilities have equal access to emergency help, using their preferred communication
    method.</p>
